Delivery Order Project

This project is mainly about in-depth programming of a online food order. Which is about 2 customers and 1 delivery driver.

As of features, there are classes that label the following: Class is a person and it leads subclasses of "customer" and "driver."
and also a class of "DeliveryOrder" to show details of it including status, customer and item ordered. 

"How to run it?" Simply just press run and then you're off

Project structure is mainly to OOP in python without any use of file handling.

This project is NOT 100% completed, my apologies
